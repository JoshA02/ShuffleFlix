# RandFlix - Random Episode Picker for Netflix
![Screenshot displaying the dice button, mentioned later](/screenshots/screenshot_01.png)

## What is this?
This is official repo for my RandFlix (formally ShuffleFlix) Chrome extension, found [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/randflix/okcbhiiklnkbhjjmbdbljdnelebhikmi)

## What does it do?
When visiting any episodic title on the Netflix website, a _dice_ button will appear, neighbouring the rating button.
After selecting it, the user will be taken to a random episode, within a random season of that show.

## Why???
This was originally made as a _quick solution_ to a problem I had, where I just wanted to watch a random episode of a show, in the background whilst studying.

## Important Mentions
This project was hastily put together in a day, so bugs and unoptimal code are to be expected; I might re-visit this in the future.
